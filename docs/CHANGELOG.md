    - There is a place for a future [`canvas`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) which can be used to transform & manipulate the image ([hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7373851/reading-the-rgb-value-of-a-canvas-pixel))
    - Simple three steps for the user:
      1. Image Upload
      2. Desired Method conversion checkboxes
      3. Message Textfield
    - Counters which indicate the total space, available space and encrypted header decode message in `KB's`,
    - ![0.2.0 Section Main](./img/changelog/020_section_main.png)
